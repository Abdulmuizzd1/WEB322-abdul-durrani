the links are 
http://localhost:3001/api/products
http://localhost:3001/api/products/1

http://localhost:3001/api/users
http://localhost:3001/api/user/1
For the api calls, they work but the text is white on white background. If you could help point out what went wrong with this it would be great

to see the users, in the username put "List" and for products, put "Products". The password being just the letter "a"

to run it run 
npm install
npm install express body-parser
node server.js
