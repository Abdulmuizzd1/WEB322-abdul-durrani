## Total Score: 81 / 100

### Comments:

Hey Adbul - overall the code is fine and the application works. I laughed at "Never give up!...." Nice touch - appreciated that.

Where you lost marks was in your project setup.

1.  no package.json so I had to create and manually install dependencies.
2.  instutcions for starting were incomplete
3.  there was no data file in the project.

The way the grading was structured you got a go0d grade but those 3 points are significant deficiencies. On the next assignment I hope to see them remedied.
